Steps to configure Header and Footer

• header.html or footer.html file must not contain any <html>, <head>, <Meta> and
    <body> tags.
• Header/Footer design should be fully independent and not having dependencies of
    any 3rd party library like Bootstrap, jQuery, etc. Also, it should not contain any
    generic styling which could conflict with the Odysseus style sheet.

• Header file must have one and only one root element i.e. header tag with class
    custom-header. That element can have one or many container div tags. Those
    container div tags must have class custom-header-container. All other HTML
    elements must be inside those containers only.

• Footer file must also have one and only one root element i.e. footer tag with class
    custom-footer. That element can have one or many container div tags. Those
    container div tags must have class custom-footer-container. All other HTML
    elements must be inside those containers only.

• All CSS must be defined with the reference of above root level selectors i.e.
    .custom-header-container for header, and .custom-footer-container for footer.

    All custom CSS class names should start with .custom-header or .custom-footer
    prefix. e.g. class for navigation bar in header should be .custom-header-nav, and
    .custom-footer-nav for footer.

• E.g. if you need to specify font-size of the navigation bar available in the header file,
    you should not specify the styles on general selectors like h1, body, p etc. You need
    to add class custom-header-nav on root element of nav bar and define CSS on
    custom-header-nav.

. custom-header-nav{font-size:20px;}

    CSS selectors should be based on classes only, as specified in above pattern. Do not
    use ID selectors in CSS.

• Do not add the reference of bootstrap CSS.

• Write required style/script in the same html file of header/footer/transition with a
    separate style/script element. 

    Do not use site preference for
    header/footer/transition specific CSS.

• Use plain JavaScript for functionalities like navigation, toggling menu/aside menu,
    etc. Usage of jQuery should be avoided.

• Do not add JavaScript code which can affect functionalities of site.
• Do not add the reference of jQuery – or else it can conflict with the other version of
jQuery included in Odysseus’s code.
• Do not keep unused or commented code.
• Code formation and cleanup should be proper.
• Header/Footer design should be responsive, and RTL supported (if required).



• Our main container’s size is set to 95% of the screen size using --main-container-
max-width CSS variable. It can be overridden according to requirement to customize
